	                <p>&emsp;Students, especially those in college, are very busy people. They usually have little to no time to deal with anything that takes a lot of time and effort to do. That is why they sometimes have hard time believing the results of their one semester's worth of effort. How to Get Away with 5.0 aims to combat that problem. It will make it easier to manage and calculate the student's progress at any point in time. It will provide information regarding the student's current semester, notably the enrolled subjects and their expected pre-final grades. This information will be based on the given grading system percentile and the student's scores. As an additional functionality, the system will also be able to base its expected grade output based on the class syllabus, if ever it is provided.<br /><br />&emsp;The system is not only geared to help students, but also teachers as well. They too can benefit from this project, since they also may have some difficulty in both keep track of and calculating their students' grades. This would be a great help especially to those teachers handling many classes and have to keep track of numerous students.</p>
